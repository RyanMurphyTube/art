              <p class="text-center-justify">Ryan Murphy engages in a precise, yet playful approach to painting, investing in the journey an artwork can take. His bold and colourful works fall within the realms of impressionism, minimalism, and geometric abstraction, practices which Ryan attempts to weave together and push into modern domains. As a multi-instrumentalist singer-songwriter, Ryan finds inspiration in music, exploring how one can translate rhythm, melody, and harmony onto canvas. Drawing from the old-guard of French painters, such as Matisse, CÃ©zanne, Degas, et al.</p>
              <p class="text-center-justify">Using digital scans of his paintings, Ryan then programs interactive, 3-dimensional versions to be experienced in VR - ultimately aiming to produce artworks which invite the viewer to consider their narrative process, in the hope of inspiring a sense of joy in the history of art.</p>
              <p class="text-center-justify">Ryan experiments with fantasy, nostalgia, and the ever-changing concept of beauty. His works frequently start in the form of quick-fire collages, which he later re-imagines as paintings - simplifying the arbitrary cutouts into intense patches of colour in oil, and later adding figurative elements - often in homage to the importance placed on the human figure found throughout 19th Century art.</p>
